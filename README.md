ðŸŸ¦I have performed three different feature detection algorithms:
1)Harris Corner Detection 
2)Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection
3)Blob Detection 

ðŸŸ¦1. Harris Corner Detection
Purpose: Detects corners in an image â€” points where the intensity changes sharply in multiple directions.

How it works:

Computes image gradients.

Measures the local intensity variation in a window.

High variation in both x and y directions = a corner.

Use case: Object tracking, motion detection.

ðŸ§  Key Point: Sensitive to edges and noise, but good at finding strong corner features.

ðŸŸ© 2. Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection
Improved version of Harris Corner Detection.

Instead of using a mathematical corner score like Harris, it directly looks at the minimum eigenvalue of the image gradient matrix.

Why better?

Only selects strong, reliable corners (more stable in tracking).

Used in: cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack().

ðŸ§  Key Point: More accurate and robust than Harris, commonly used in feature tracking (e.g., KLT tracker).

ðŸŸ¦ 3. Blob Detection
Purpose: Finds regions in an image that differ in properties like brightness or size compared to surrounding areas.

Detects:

Circular blobs

Irregular bright/dark spots

How it works:

Analyzes connected pixels based on thresholds.

Filters blobs by area, circularity, convexity, etc.

Used in: Medical imaging, shape detection.

ðŸŸ¦ Key Differences:
Aspect	Harris	Shi-Tomasi	Blob Detection
Detects	Corners	Strong Corners	Regions/Blobs
Based On	Gradient matrix	Eigenvalue filtering	Shape & intensity
Shape Sensitivity	Corners only	Corners only	Circular & irregular
Accuracy	Medium	High	Depends on filters
Usage Example	Edge matching	Motion tracking	Object counting

ðŸŸ¦Conclusion:
Harris, Shi-Tomasi, and Blob Detection are all used to detect important features in images but serve different purposes:

Harris detects corners based on intensity changes â€” good for identifying sharp features.

Shi-Tomasi improves upon Harris by selecting only the strongest and most reliable corners.

Blob Detection finds circular or irregular regions â€” useful for detecting objects without corners.
